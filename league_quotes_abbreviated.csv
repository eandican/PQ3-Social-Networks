"Teemo","Captain Teemo on duty."
"Teemo","Yes, sir!"
"Teemo","Armed and ready."
"Teemo","Reporting in."
"Teemo","Hut, two, three, four."
"Teemo","Yes, sir!"
"Teemo","I'll scout ahead!"
"Teemo","Swiftly!"
"Teemo","That's gotta sting."
"Teemo","Never underestimate the power of the Scout's code."
"Teemo","Size doesn't mean everything."
"Teemo","Yes, sir!"
"Teemo","Reporting in."
"Teemo","Swiftly!"
"Teemo","Hut, two, three, four."
"Teemo","I'll scout ahead!"
"Teemo","Armed and ready."
"Teemo","That's gotta sting."
"Teemo","Survive here a week, then you get a name."
"Teemo","There's a mushroom out there with your name on it."
"Teemo","The war never ends, the battlefield just changes."
"Teemo","Survival ain't pretty."
"Teemo","Reinforcements ain't comin'."
"Teemo","I'm the last scout standing."
"Teemo","Lots to do before I punch out."
"Teemo","I forget what started the fighting..."
"Teemo","You don't know about war."
"Teemo","Good men die. I choose to live."
"Teemo","You'd be surprised how quick fur ignites."
"Teemo","Size is a liability."
"Teemo","Nobody's innocent any more."
"Teemo","One day there'll be a reckoning."
"Teemo","You can't tell but, uh, I've grown quite the beard under here."
"Teemo","I've done things I'm not proud of."
"Teemo","I used to live by a code."
"Teemo","They been looking for yours truly."
"Teemo","Never. Get. Attached."
"Teemo","Tall folk don't last long round here."
"Teemo","My ears are always ringing."
"Teemo","A part of you never leaves the jungle."
"Teemo","We ain't all makin' it out of here."
"Teemo","Peace is a fairy tale."
"Teemo","War didn't change me, I changed war!"
"Teemo","My tears have all dried up, kid."
"Teemo","You've got no idea what it's like on the ground, flyboy!"
"Teemo","Little guy's gone native."
"Teemo","Wars are won with men, not machines."
"Teemo","Rockets ain't for jumping. Who gave you that?"
"Teemo","Everyone's on a clock, but only mine keeps ticking."
"Teemo","You want Teemo? Come and get him!"
"Teemo","Take a long walk through the jungle!"
"Teemo","You and I are survivors, buddy. They can never kill us."
"Teemo","Here you go, little guy. You're my only friend left."
"Teemo","We'll make them pay for what they did to your family, little guy."
"Teemo","They won't make the mistake of thinking you're harmless again."
"Teemo","Time for the long nap."
"Teemo","Sight. Shoot. Reload."
"Teemo","I'm taking everyone with me!"
"Teemo","Death has a name."
"Teemo","This one's for my helmet brother!"
"Teemo","This'll be messy."
"Teemo","This is very personal."
"Teemo","Natural-born killer."
"Teemo","Smell that? That's fear."
"Teemo","Killing's all I'm good at."
"Teemo","I don't feel anything."
"Teemo","I settle my scores."
"Teemo","Let the poison do its work."
"Teemo","Turns out, I got a proficiency in killing."
"Teemo","This is where we draw the line."
"Teemo","This one's for Johnny!"
"Teemo","Who's my next tally mark?"
"Teemo","Take the pain!"
"Teemo","Look alive."
"Teemo","Now, we wait."
"Teemo","Become one with the jungle."
"Teemo","Patience now."
"Teemo","Blind 'em!"
"Teemo","Bug out!"
"Teemo","Hut two three four!"
"Teemo","Move!"
"Teemo","Swiftly!"
"Teemo","I own this land."
"Teemo","Face toward enemy."
"Teemo","Another mushroom, another victim."
"Teemo","Got a little surprise for 'em."
"Teemo","More where that came from."
"Teemo","You're welcome."
"Teemo","Watch your step."
"Teemo","Teemo'd."
"Teemo","Armed and ready."
"Teemo","I'm everywhere."
"Teemo","Next time I see Nashor, I'll yank a couple more."
"Teemo","Got teeth? You got a weapon."
"Teemo","We all live in the jaws of the beast."
"Teemo","This is gonna sting."
"Teemo","Some masks you never take off."
"Teemo","Let 'em die slow."
"Teemo","Time to put on my killin' hat."
"Teemo","Mete out the pain."
"Teemo","There's no such thing as collateral damage."
"Teemo","One on three? Best odds yet."
"Teemo","Fighting fair is a good way to die."
"Teemo","This coulda saved a lot of good men."
"Teemo","Two and a half seconds is all it takes."
"Teemo","Sometimes, time stands still, and all you can do is watch."
"Teemo","I know everything that happens here."
"Teemo","Nobody gets past Teemo."
"Teemo","Never let your guard down."
"Teemo","There's nothing left here."
"Teemo","Coming in hot!"
"Teemo","Need to get patched up!"
"Teemo","As Captain of The Groove Guard, I get to write our guidelines and make sure everybody follows 'em! Haha!"
"Teemo","Remember your ABCs: always be cool. Haha!"
"Teemo","Goop troop, are we ready? ♪"
"Teemo","Woop! Another world, another stop on the Hyperfunk Supervibeway!"

"Teemo","Groove Guard Rule 10: boogie responsibly."
"Teemo","Got a mate like a shot slime and electric slide!"
"Teemo","Groove Guard Rule 240: bring down the house... then check for survivors."
"Teemo","I go where the disc-goes."
"Teemo","With the right mindset, anywhere can be a discothèque."
"Teemo","I put the disco in discord! Yeah, oooh yeah!"
"Teemo","♪ Hanging with my boogies — boogies! ♪"

"Teemo","Zoom zoom zoom!"
"Teemo","Before recreational boogieing, there can be no outstanding boogie duties. Better make this quick!"
"Teemo","Woo! New Groove Guard Rule number... 299: always crash a party in style."
"Teemo","As far as I'm concerned, if your vibes are fly, you're all right in my eye."
"Teemo","As long as I've got these boogies, I know I'll be just fine! Woo! Yeah! A-ha!"
"Teemo","Ahh, nothing beats 'sploring the galaxy in my goop cruiser."
"Teemo","The Jam is the farthest out of all far out intergalactic dance parties! (sigh) But I'm on a mission."
"Teemo","The Hyperfunk Supervibeway means even more interstellar friends."
"Teemo","Feels like I'm on alien race Space Race, and I gotta skate-skate for my life!"
"Teemo","Sliming people, gooping up the galaxy. The boogie business!"
"Teemo","I'm one with The Groove and The Groove is with me."
"Teemo","Gonna send my new buddies to the big hot tub in the sky! (laughs) Oh I see how that could sound like a threat."
"Teemo","Ooh... You've got moxy. I like it."
"Teemo","Gimme some slime! Sike!"
"Teemo","Whoa! What world are you from?!"
"Teemo","Woo... Haha! Looks like someone woke up on the dark side of the moon."

"Teemo","That's not what I meant by 'hit the floor'."
"Teemo","Off to the great litter box in the sky, Blitz! Huh... No idea where you're going, Crank."
"Teemo","Peace, love and party on, Gragas."
"Teemo","Tsk tsk! Shouldn't have come between me and a good time, Lissandra."
"Teemo","Don't worry, Nami! I'll keep your record spinning!"
"Teemo","Gosh Ornn. I've never out partyed a god before. Far out!"
"Teemo","I thought we were going to 'splore the galaxies, Taric. What happened?"

"Teemo","Booking it!"
"Teemo","Peace out!"
"Teemo","Gotta jet!"
"Teemo","Gotta bounce!"
"Teemo","Catch you on the flip side!"
"Teemo","Where The Groove leads, I follow!"
"Teemo","(Yawn) Can't groove, if you don't snooze."
"Teemo","I just... can't boogie no... mo...re..."
"Teemo","You... threw off my... grooooove..."
"Teemo","Boogie... down..."
"Teemo","Owwwww... Ooo... Oh... Owww..."
"Teemo","Another day, another disco inferno!"
"Teemo","Live by the funk, die by the funk!"
"Teemo","Jeepers. That wasn't very boogie-licious."
"Teemo","Feeling astronomical!"

"Teemo","♪ Can't stop the funk! ♪"
"Teemo","Back by popular demand!"
"Thresh","What delightful agony we shall inflict."
"Thresh","It's over when I say."
"Thresh","Torment comes in so many flavors."
"Thresh","What is the worth of a soul?"
"Thresh","Ah, the sweet tones of misery."
"Thresh","I am the thing under the bed."
"Thresh","Relax, just... let go."
"Thresh","Oh, the eternity we shall spend together."
"Thresh","Hmm, whose mind shall we snap?"
"Thresh","Me, mad? Haha... quite likely."
"Thresh","Poor lost souls."
"Thresh","Flesh is a prison."
"Thresh","Ever seen your soul? Would you like to?"" *slurps*"
"Thresh","You're falling apart. What to do with the pieces?"
"Thresh","Screaming won't do you any good, but it's music to my ears."
"Thresh","There is life. There is death. And then there is me."
"Thresh","Lock 'em up."
"Thresh","Death? No... nothing that simple."
"Thresh","Nobody escapes."
"Thresh","It's over when I say."
"Thresh","Wretched mongrels get the leash."
"Thresh","Come out and play."
"Thresh","Writhe, like a worm on a hook."
"Thresh","No one can save them."
"Thresh","Any last words?"
"Thresh","Oh, yes! It's about to get much worse."
"Thresh","Come back."

"Thresh","Round we go!"
"Thresh","This way!"
"Thresh","My house, my rules."
"Thresh","Nowhere to hide."
"Thresh","I own you."
"Thresh","Closing in..."
"Thresh","No weapon in any reality can harm us."
"Thresh","Stars cold of life. Silent in the darkness."
"Thresh","I will guide them beyond the brink of infinity."
"Thresh","Let's see how dark it can really get."
"Thresh","A star can scream. Isn't that strange?"
"Thresh","We shall suck the marrow from their stars."
"Thresh","Even the universe will grind to a halt."
"Thresh","Cosmic extinction... how lovely."
"Thresh","The cry of a dying star... nothing's sweeter."
"Thresh","We will consume this world."
"Thresh","A sinister star indeed."
"Thresh","Ours is a kingdom of darkness."
"Thresh","The stars are no longer infinite."
"Thresh","I will chain the very heavens and drag them down."
"Thresh","The nothingness accepts all."
"Thresh","All things are eventually extinguished."
"Thresh","Great works, broken and destroyed."
"Thresh","I envy those who journey into the nothingness."
"Thresh","Infinity, rapture, I am their harbinger."
"Thresh","Not even gods dare look within."
"Thresh","Oh, how I long for the final kiss of annihilation."
"Thresh","We sup upon the living galaxies themselves."
"Thresh","Do not prolong the inevitable."
"Thresh","Nothing escapes the pull of eternity!"
"Thresh","Beyond the stars... hide horrors far greater than any can imagine."
"Thresh","Have you ever seen a thousand stars alight in a shared dawn? We have, just before we snuffed them out."
"Thresh","Join your precious stars in oblivion."
"Thresh","Not even a star can escape our grip."
"Thresh","Just try to take it, sackman!"
"Thresh","Suns, moons? We have devoured both."
"Thresh","Time is but a cog in a dying machine."
"Thresh","Suns, moons? We have devoured both."
"Thresh","What is one life... among billions?"
"Thresh","Join her, in oblivion."
"Thresh","Ahh, the light of Demacia. So sweet."
"Thresh","We will show you true darkness."
"Thresh","How will you protect an entire world... when you cannot even save yourself?"
"Thresh","Enough death and darkness... even for you."
"Thresh","You are not prepared for this journey."
"Thresh","Come to me, my herald."
"Thresh","Serve well, and you shall die well."
"Thresh","Go forth, and destroy."
"Thresh","Together, we shall watch the last star die."
"Thresh","What better revenge than complete annihilation?"
"Thresh","Your betrayal will not save them."
"Thresh","Your betrayal will not save them."
"Thresh","How do you intend to stop entropy incarnate?"
"Thresh","Time... is but a cog in a dying machine."
"Thresh","We have looked into the Void... and consumed it."
"Thresh","Pretenders to the throne of annihilation."
"Thresh","A frog pops up near Thresh, but is sucked into his black-hole ""lantern"" by mistake."
"Thresh","Look at you. I think I'll keep you... or not."
"Thresh","Oh, I've always wanted one of these... oh man."
"Thresh","Stillness, for all eternity."
"Thresh","They struggle. How meaningless."
"Thresh","Brave souls, destroyed and consumed."
"Thresh","Come. Bear witness."
"Thresh","The meaning of life is that it stops."
"Thresh","We will all collapse into one."
"Thresh","Submit to infinity!"
"Thresh","I am the herald of reality's end."
"Thresh","We are the death of hope."
"Thresh","A dark star rises."
"Thresh","Snuff them out."
"Thresh","Annihilation awaits."
"Thresh","The galaxy will suffocate in darkness."
"Thresh","We hunger."
"Thresh","Their suffering makes us stronger."
"Thresh","Enter the horizon."
"Thresh","Gaze into the eye of annihilation."
"Thresh","We are shadows cast by darkness."
"Thresh","Do not fear the end. Embrace it."
"Thresh","Another soul to feed the endless hunger."
"Thresh","I will carve my way across the stars."
"Thresh","Eternity beckons."
"Thresh","We've destroyed our fair share of dragons."
"Thresh","Those wings offer no escape."
"Thresh","Just another stupid beast."
"Thresh","Soul or no, I will feed it to the nothingness."
"Thresh","I've destroyed realities. What threat is this beast?"
"Thresh","A baron, eh? Baron of a dead world."
"Thresh","Yes..."
"Thresh","Death is no escape."
"Thresh","Become one in death."
"Thresh","Oh, what a wonderful world."
"Thresh","A fine start."
"Thresh","A trillion souls to go."
"Thresh","My pull is inexorable."
"Thresh","Nothing escapes our hunger."
"Thresh","Join us in death."
"Thresh","We shall hunt you to the ends of creation."
"Thresh","Space is no impediment."
"Thresh","Nowhere left to run."
"Thresh","Distance is an illusion."
"Thresh","Your efforts are meaningless."
"Thresh","Embrace entropy."
"Thresh","Of your own accord."
"Thresh","Feel my power."
"Thresh","Take a trip to the end of the world."
"Thresh","Join me."
"Thresh","You are now in my orbit."
"Thresh","The downward spiral."
"Thresh","Become part of something greater: nothingness."
"Thresh","Death is but a dream."
"Thresh","Welcome to the event horizon."
"Thresh","We are inescapable."
"Thresh","The stars die as we approach."
"Thresh","Dreadful symmetry."
"Thresh","There is nowhere to run. We've destroyed it all."
"Thresh","Their screams sing me to my eternal sleep."
"Thresh","Infinity is confined."
"Thresh","If the universe cared, it would stop us."
"Thresh","Not even light can escape us."
"Thresh","They all seem to die with a whimper."
"Thresh","They feed the very engine of their destruction."
"Thresh","I am the vanishing point on all horizons!"
"Thresh","How charming."
"Thresh","Fine craftsmanship, for a dead people."
"Thresh","Oh, such destruction to come!"
"Thresh","Use their defenses against them."
"Thresh","No legion can stand before us."
"Thresh","What's an aegis anyway?"
"Thresh","Speed their deaths."
"Thresh","Eye for an eye."
"Thresh","Even the least of them may yet serve us in death."
"Thresh","Mortal trappings."
"Thresh","Not nearly big enough."
"Thresh","My other belt is made of dead stars."
"Thresh","Useful."
"Thresh","A bauble."
"Thresh","Ah, if it could only kindle hope. Haha!"
"Thresh","Not quite my style, but it will have to do."
"Thresh","Hm, they worship suns. Too bad."
"Thresh","A means to the end."
"Thresh","Wait 'til they get a load of us."
"Thresh","We'll make relics of them all."
"Thresh","They won't be needing this."
"Thresh","I'll take it."
"Thresh","Targon should brace itself."
"Thresh","None living shall escape my sight."
"Thresh","Just because you are beneath my notice doesn't mean I can't see you."
"Thresh","Leave nothing to chance."
"Thresh","Hiding will not save you."
"Thresh","One day, this hunger will be sated."
"Thresh","Much more work to do."
"Thresh","Watch the stars blink out, one by one."
"Thresh","*grunts* ""Finally..."
"Thresh","...the embrace of nothingness..."
"Thresh","...oh, thank you..."
"Thresh","Only a few more stars, a few more galaxies..."
"Thresh","Time, space, reality... we shall consume all."
"Thresh","Beware... I live."
"Thresh","Come, children of hopes and dreams. Let me show you what life cannot."
"Thresh","My collection is my family, and its spirits, my beloved children."
"Thresh","Lost spirits everywhere. I must guide them home."
"Thresh","Tiny twinkles of life, struggling ever so intensely. I will light their path."
"Thresh","Ah... life. So simple, so naive, like a flower yet to bloom."
"Thresh","'Torment' is such a harsh word. I prefer 'nurture.'"
"Thresh","Cruelty is a gift I learn from the living."
"Thresh","Spirits, alone and forsaken. I grant them all purpose."
"Thresh","To the living, I am a demon. To the dead, I am a savior."
"Thresh","Poor lost souls. I must save them all from themselves."
"Thresh","Why must they fear me? I do not bite, I merely collect."
"Thresh","Every spirit is useful. That is why I must collect them all."
"Thresh","They think me a god? *scoffs* No. Nothing that... simple."
"Thresh","Nothing more beautiful than death."
"Thresh","No matter the season, death blossoms."
"Thresh","Life is a prison."
"Thresh","What is the worth of a spirit?"
"Thresh","No need to rush! Death will bless us all!"
"Thresh","I am not the end. I am the final awakening."
"Thresh","I do not discriminate. All must find comfort inside my lantern."
"Thresh","Death, what a pretty word."
"Thresh","Life is pain, I am sweet release."
"Thresh","My magic is older than life."
"Thresh","Blessed are those who need my guidance."
"Thresh","Me, mad? *laughs* They have no idea."
"Thresh","I herald the greatest blessing."
"Thresh","Screams of agony echo my favorite melodies."
"Thresh","To live is to suffer. To survive, is to find beauty in the suffering."
"Thresh","In death, we become family."
"Thresh","The dead passing to spirits. The spirits passing to my collection. That is how it must be."
"Thresh","In life, you are heroes and villains. In death, you are all my children."
"Thresh","Do not fear me. I am but a servant of the natural order that guides us all."
"Thresh","That little fox and I once guided spirits together, but now, I must save them from her errant ways."
"Thresh","Without me, the dead would be lost. I am what drives them to greatness."
"Thresh","I am friends with all spirits, until they decide to question me."
"Thresh","Poor lost spirits beckoning to bloom. I've been waiting for you."
"Thresh","Do not worry, my dear spirits, you will all be safe in my collection."
"Thresh","My children, my collection, blossom with potential."
"Thresh","The living say, 'Look death in the eye.' *chuckles* I do love an intimate connection."
"Thresh","No one understands the intricacies of my collection, and that is why I must never stop!"
"Thresh","Those privy to my secrets? *chuckles* They are safe with me now."
"Thresh","Deny me your spirit. I do enjoy a good chase."
"Thresh","You think yourself clever. But once a little fox, always a little fox."
"Thresh","Cassiopeia, you treat the spirits with tender-loving cruelty. *chuckles* That, I admire."
"Thresh","Wolf, why do you let this... girl keep you on a leash? I pity you."
"Thresh","They took your home, Lillia, do not forget this loss. Let it course through you."
"Thresh","Lucian, that name. Perhaps we met in another life. Perhaps... you failed to catch my attention."
"Thresh","Riven, a spirit betrayed by her own kind. That is a tragedy I adore."
"Thresh","Senna, my dear girl. I do hope you enjoyed your taste of freedom, but now, you must come home."
"Thresh","Why, why do you exist? You... stupid... raccoon dog!"
"Thresh","You, Chain Warden, you have potential beyond your own understanding."
"Thresh","Hunting demons only to become one yourself? Vayne - *chuckles* - I will make you precious."
"Thresh","Yasuo, the heroic warlord I've been hearing all about. I must say, I'm disappointed."
"Thresh","Yone, the eldest son overshadowed by his younger brother. How could you possibly rest in peace?"
"Thresh","Your spirit seems lacking in, uh... anything of value."
"Thresh","Many spirits have potential, but yours... yours will simply fade."
"Thresh","A life not worth savoring. A death not worth remembering."
"Thresh","Taunt me again. I do love hearing you mask your insecurities."
"Thresh","Who's a good demon lantern? *chuckles* You are."
"Thresh","Don't spoil your dinner now."
"Thresh","My little pet. Dinner."
"Thresh","Oh dear. Your wit faded long ago."
"Thresh","You belong to me!"
"Thresh","I've been waiting!"
"Thresh","Enjoy."
"Thresh","Such potential!"
"Thresh","Join your siblings!"
"Thresh","I will grant you purpose."
"Thresh","Another lost soul."
"Thresh","No more games!"
"Thresh","Naughty little one!"
"Thresh","Die and rejoice!"
"Thresh","Play with me."
"Thresh","Let it all go."
"Thresh","A wandering soul."
"Thresh","You are chosen."
"Thresh","Freedom awaits!"
"Thresh","Wretched spirits get the leash!"
"Thresh","I've been waiting for you."
"Thresh","Oh, yes, challenge me!"
"Thresh","For my collection!"
"Thresh","You are lost. Allow me!"
"Thresh","The end begins!"
"Thresh","No need to struggle."
"Thresh","Come hither!"
"Thresh","Are you lost?"
"Thresh","Wrong way!"
"Thresh","Where are you off to?"
"Thresh","Kindle their spirits!"
"Thresh","Go."
"Thresh","Light their path!"
"Thresh","It doesn't bite!"
"Thresh","Breathe, my children."
"Thresh","No you don't!"
"Thresh","You know better!"
"Thresh","Uh-uh-uhh."
"Thresh","I don't think so."
"Thresh","Oh no."
"Thresh","Welcome home!"
"Thresh","You are mine!"
"Thresh","This is freedom!"
"Thresh","Hush, now. You are home."
"Thresh","Welcome to my family."
"Thresh","Rest. I will take good care... of you."
"Thresh","And now, you have purpose."
"Thresh","Call me father if you wish."
"Thresh","Bye-bye, little fox. Your children rest with me now."
"Thresh","Rest now, Cassiopeia. I will take good care of your collected spirits."
"Thresh","Enjoy your freedom, little wolf."
"Thresh","Dreams of hope? No! I am afraid I cannot allow that, Lillia."
"Thresh","Lucian, Lucian, Lucian... no, still doesn't ring a bell."
"Thresh","Riven - *chuckles* - severed... broken."
"Thresh","Welcome home, my dear Senna."
"Thresh","That was no spirit, no demon. That... was an abomination!"
"Thresh","Almost felt like I lost a piece of myself."
"Thresh","Look what you've become. You are my favorite child, my favorite Vayne!"
"Thresh","So whiny, so angry! Typical of the second son."
"Thresh","Worry not, Yone. Your little brother is safe with me, too."
"Thresh","Five spirits, a completed collection."
"Thresh","A father must always look his best."
"Thresh","Glowing, upward."
"Thresh","A better look, for better times."
"Thresh","Ahhhh, that's better."
"Thresh","Dry your eyes. I won't be gone for long."
"Thresh","Don't run off too far now. I'll only be a moment."
"Thresh","Don't you know? Absence makes the heart grow fonder."
"Thresh","The sweet... embrace..."
"Thresh","No light... only... joy..."
"Thresh","Ah, the beautiful bangs of resurrection."
"Thresh","Death is inevitable."
"Thresh","I hope my children didn't miss me too much."
"Thresh","Welcome to Summoner's Rift."
"Thresh","Minions have spawned."

"Volibear","Feel the power of the wild."
"Volibear","You have the heart of a weakling."
"Volibear","The land will exist far longer than warm-bloods."
"Volibear","Their bones are ash and soil. Mine rumble with wild thunder."
"Volibear","Follow me and we will bring down sky!"
"Volibear","This ground will tremble with the first storm!"
"Volibear","The land belongs to the wild. Today, we reclaim it with tooth and claw."
"Volibear","Gods do not beg. We take what is ours!"
"Volibear","I will unleash the Freljord."
"Volibear","We are all blood of the wild."
"Volibear","Hirnvel are sacred. Tree, soil, beast, blood!"
"Volibear","I split mountains with my roar!"
"Volibear","The creations of mortals fail. The wild remains."
"Volibear","My thunder shakes the foundations of the world!"
"Volibear","Many have tried to end me. A god."
"Volibear","With each step I take, the wind gathers, and the Vrestrom grows!"
"Volibear","The ursine speak for man and the wild responds."
"Volibear","When the night is cruel and dark..."
"Volibear","Men speak in small words. I speak in thunder!"
"Volibear","Once, history was writ by tooth and claw."
"Volibear","I will roar the world into stillness... so must it be."
"Volibear","They have lost their wild. I will guide them."
"Volibear","The soil hungers for blood."
"Volibear","To destroy is to free."
"Volibear","Warm-bloods rose on two legs... and forgot how to run."
"Volibear","Let the land thunder with my storm."
"Volibear","Battle boils the blood."
"Volibear","What happens when old wounds heal?"
"Volibear","Hmm. I taste iron on the wind... blood."
"Volibear","This place has been tamed. I will untame it!"
"Volibear","Let the storm follow in my wake."
"Volibear","Ice hides the fury within."
"Volibear","I carve my path with blood, and bone."
"Volibear","Bones crunch. Blood drips. This is the way of old Vorrijaard."
"Volibear","My land was named by a god. It cannot be renamed by a coward."
"Volibear","They call me Valhir. The Volibear. Greatstorm. My true name is mine alone."
"Volibear","Clouds are the storm-cloak I wrap around my fur."
"Volibear","Even in a cowardly man the heart is wild. That is why it must be eaten last."
"Volibear","Thunder roars. Wind howls. Only fools ignore the call to battle."
"Volibear","I am Valhir of the first thunder, destroyer of the white mountain, carver of the five Fjords!"
"Volibear","They have forgotten the old ways. The old ways have not forgotten them."
"Volibear","The land slumbers, but it is not dead. With my roar, I wake it. With my thunder, I call it."
"Volibear","Raise your idols. Huddle beneath your stone trees! Today, I tear them all down."
"Volibear","Many have called to me. Avarosans. Frostguard. Winter's claw. They call no longer..."
"Volibear","In my dreams, I see bones frozen in ice. I wonder... if they are my own."
"Volibear","My blood is of the Vorrijaard, the land before the Freljord."
"Volibear","When my brother gave them fire, they forgot the fire of their own blood."
"Volibear","Darkening clouds. An omen to those who stand against the wild!"
"Volibear","My sisters are gods of ice and salt and ever-winter. And Ornn? A liar."
"Volibear","I am a god. I cannot die. But do I live if I am not in the hearts of warriors?"
"Volibear","I still taste their ancestors... stuck between my teeth."
"Volibear","Your towers will splinter like rotten teeth!"
"Volibear","You? Such a feeble sacrifice."
"Volibear","Your gods are cowards!"
"Volibear","I was uprooting towns when your elders were crawling."
"Volibear","Play at rage, warm-blood. I will taste the fear quivering in your guts."
"Volibear","My sister. Together, we would harness a storm to consume the Freljord!"
"Volibear","Sister. How long can you endure the ice burning in your heart?"
"Volibear","Your war-mothers do not know true war, Ashe."
"Volibear","I knew Avarosa, Ashe. Just as foolish as you."
"Volibear","The heart is strong, Braum. And tastiest after battle."
"Volibear","Braum. You have the lip fur of a lowly cub. Half of it is milk!"
"Volibear","You have no power here young witch."
"Volibear","Boy! ...And beast."
"Volibear","The heart of a child is untamed. Violent in its hope... cruel in its despair..."
"Volibear","You've gone soft, brother. Too much cake."
"Volibear","Brother. You have lost your strongest weapons. They wither, and decay..."
"Volibear","You emerge from your mountain cave, brother. Let us end this."
"Volibear","Ornn. You once denied me your weapons. Now, I no longer need them."
"Volibear","Rengar! I heard of your hunt. And I heard of your failure."
"Volibear","Tell me, Rengar. Do your trophies make you stronger or do they weigh you down?"
"Volibear"," Bristle! Why do you bow to this weak-willed warm-blood?"
"Volibear","Hmm. You think you can be savage Tryndamere?"
"Volibear","What a-what is that? A cub?"
"Volibear","Do you have something against bears old man?"
"Volibear","Weakling!"
"Volibear","Coward!"
"Volibear","Show me your baby fangs again. How dear."
"Volibear","Live for a few centuries and you will try everything at least once."
"Volibear","It is better than staring at dirt."
"Volibear","The first river was a river of blood! What has my brother been telling you?"
"Volibear","Your shrines will fall!"
"Volibear","I will not be forgotten!"
"Volibear","Weakling!"
"Volibear","Vol dusk skaar!"
"Volibear","Vol kau fera!"
"Volibear","I roar, you bow."
"Volibear","Storm devour you!"
"Volibear","Torn to bone!"
"Volibear","Bleed, offering!"
"Volibear","I run. I tear!"
"Volibear","You cannot kill a storm."
"Volibear","Rolling thunder."
"Volibear","Nothing but meat."
"Volibear","You mean to kill me?"
"Volibear","You cannot tame lightning."
"Volibear","I am Valhir."
"Volibear","Blood, hahahaha, always tastes the same."
"Volibear","Ever-winter take you."
"Volibear","Tremble at my roar!"
"Volibear","Truth lurks in a warm-blood's guts."
"Volibear","Your gods fear me."
"Volibear","Break them open."
"Volibear","Skulls, spines always crunch."
"Volibear","So frail."
"Volibear","A thousand scars. What is one more?"
"Volibear","The ground is sown in blood."
"Volibear","Tearing flesh!"
"Volibear","All will crumble!"
"Volibear","Storm unleashed!"
"Volibear","Vrestrom consume you!"
"Volibear","I am the storm!"
"Volibear","So must it be."
"Volibear","I feast on your heart."
"Volibear","Blood. The way of the land."
"Volibear","Such a death. Far greater than your life."
"Volibear","A feast for the Earth."
"Volibear","Your lies feed the soil."
"Volibear","Another coward dies."
"Volibear","My sister. May you return on swift wings."
"Volibear","Oh, brother. Your forge is empty and cold."
"Volibear","Ornn's blood on my claws. Surely, there was a reason. Surely, this is just..."
"Volibear","I unmake your shrines!"
"Volibear","Down with false idols!"
"Volibear","Nothing but rubble!"
"Volibear","Beneath this stone I sense no wild."
"Volibear","I hear them calling Valhir. The Vrestrom answers!"
"Volibear","Sky calls to me!"
"Volibear","The storm gathers, and I enter sky!"
"Volibear","Storms dance upon the soil."
"Volibear","Born in war I fall... in war."
"Volibear","I... do... not... die!"
"Volibear","Whose heart calls the storm?"
"Volibear","A god cannot die."
"Volibear","I rise wreathed in lightning!"
"Volibear","A fool and his head are soon parted"
"Volibear","A fool and his money are easily parted"
